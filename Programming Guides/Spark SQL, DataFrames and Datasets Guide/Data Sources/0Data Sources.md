# Data Sources

> Spark SQL supports operating on a variety of data sources through the DataFrame interface. A DataFrame can be operated on using relational transformations and can also be used to create a temporary view. Registering a DataFrame as a temporary view allows you to run SQL queries over its data. This section describes the general methods for loading and saving data using the Spark Data Sources and then goes into specific options that are available for the built-in data sources.
